\begin{abstract}
In 1911, Otto Toeplitz, a German mathematician, proposed the celebrated conjecture: \emph{Does every simple, closed, non-self-intersecting Jordan curve inscribe a square—that is, can four points on the curve always be found that form the vertices of a square?}

Over the years, numerous partial results have deepened our understanding of this geometric-topological problem, with the conjecture being resolved for many special classes of curves. Yet, the general case for arbitrary Jordan curves remains unsolved.

In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called the \textbf{method of delta-rotations}, which considers a configuration of two perpendicular line segments entirely contained within the interior of a Jordan curve. This configuration is rotated and slid along the curve’s periphery such that the orthogonality is preserved and all four endpoints remain on the curve.

To maintain smooth and continuous mappings—and to avoid obstructions during deformation—we propose an additional technique called the \textbf{method of surging}, which shifts one of the lines parallel to the other, preserving orthogonality while circumventing local blockages.

If, through this process, the perpendicular lines are shown to exchange lengths during their motion, then by continuity and the \emph{Intermediate Value Theorem}, there must exist a configuration where both lines attain equal lengths, thereby forming the diagonals of an inscribed square.
